  <h1>Santa Barbara Beaches</h1>
  <h2>We're lucky to call some of the most beautiful beaches on Earth, home!</h2>

	<h2>Mesa Lane</h2>
	<p>Mesa Lane is a popular option. People love that it is dog friendly, but be warned of the steep staircase down to the beach!</p>

<section>
	<h2>Thousand Steps</h2>
	<p>Another fan favorite! Easy to access from the Mesa or Downtown, but less busy than town beaches. Again, fair warning on some slippery steps in order to access!</p>

<section>
	<h2>Leadbetter</h2>
	<p>Lovely beach that is easily accessible from the Harbor or downtown. Bring a surboard, you might get lucky and score some waves!</p>
